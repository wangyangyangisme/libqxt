# Sample .rpmmacros file -- copy this to your home directory with that name

# The packager, distribution & vendor may be edited as appropriate. To sign
# packages, you must generate a GPG key, edit the "_gpg_name" setting to
# match the key verbatim and remove the hash from those 3 lines. Before
# packages may be installed, the target machines will need the public key
# installed into rpm using "rpm --import <public-key-file>". This is usually
# included in a repository configuration/versioning package (rpmforge-release
# is a good example) and installed with GPG checking disabled to "bootstrap"
# the repository. The naming convention for keys is RPM-GPG-KEY.<distribution>
# and typically installed in the /etc/pki/rpm-gpg directory.
